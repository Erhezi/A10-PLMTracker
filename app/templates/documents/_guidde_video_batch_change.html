    <p>00:00: This tutorial explains how to perform batch changes, filter records, and link related tasks to keep conversions in sync.</p>
    <p>00:12: Click Batch Change to start modifying multiple records at once.</p>
    <p>00:17: Use the toggle to enable batch mode.</p>

    <p>00:37: Select multiple rows with the checkboxes.</p>
    <p>00:42: Click Change Project Stage to update all selected rows.</p>
    <p>00:46: Pick the correct stage from the dropdown.</p>
    <p>00:51: Reopen the dropdown if you need to adjust the choice.</p>
    <p>01:00: Use Create Wrike Task buttons to link tracker rows to Wrike.</p>
    <p>01:06: Open Create Wrike Task - Set-up Inventory to enter the 10-digit ID.</p>
    <p>01:16: Download Excel exports the selected data for review or edits across all locations.</p>
    <p>01:33: Apply Wrike ID assigns the entered ID to the selected rows.</p>
    <p>01:39: Batch associate par location setup tasks in the same way.</p>

    <p>02:35: Manage batches by stage and product type to keep lifecycle tracking clear.</p>
    <p>02:44: Items entering as Pending Clinical Readiness should have inventory and par setup tasks; those entering as Pending Item Number should first have Get Item Number tasks, after which the tracker advances them automatically.</p>
    <p>03:06: You have completed a batch change by filtering, changing stages, linking Wrike, and exporting data for coordinated follow-up.</p>
