    <p>00:00: This tutorial guides you through using the batch upload function to add and replace item relations efficiently.</p>
    <p>00:06: Before starting, ensure you have your Excel file prepared with the correct headers for a smooth upload process.</p>
    <p>00:12: Click Batch Upload to access the batch upload functionality for managing item relations.</p>
    <p>00:18: Make sure the Excel file has only two columns, Item and Replace Item, then enter the six-digit item numbers under the appropriate column.</p>
    <p>00:27: To add a discontinued item, place NO REPLACEMENT (uppercase) under the Replace Item column.</p>
    <p>00:35: Once the Excel file is ready, start the batch process.</p>
    <p>00:39: Use the picker to locate the Excel file.</p>
    <p>00:42: Click Upload and Ingest to add items in bulk.</p>
    <p>00:46: In this example one link is skipped.</p>

    <p>00:55: Click Groups.</p>
    <p>00:57: Review the newly added relations in the main table.</p>
    <p>01:03: You have successfully used the batch upload function to add and replace item relations efficiently.</p>
    <p>01:09: Next, manage these relations further or update your batch files as needed.</p>
