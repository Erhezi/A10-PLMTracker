    <p>00:00: This tutorial guides you through using the dashboard to manage and analyze inventory data effectively.</p>
    <p>00:06: You will learn how to filter information, visualize data, export reports, and notify relevant stakeholders.</p>
    <p>00:13: On dashboard page, we can roughly divide the page into 3 parts: the filters, the tables, and the charts.</p>
    <p>00:20: The filters are located at the top of the page, and we can filter by item groups, locations, stage, and descriptions.</p>
    <p>00:27: On the left hand side of the page, we have two tables, the top one is the inventory locations and the bottom one is par locations. We have our tracked items put to their designated locations in those tables for users to explore.</p>
    <p>00:39: On the right hand side of the page, we have our charting section.</p>
    <p>00:43: When user clicked on a item on inventory or par location table, the chart helps to visualize how the source and replacement items are being used over time.</p>
    <p>00:53: The top chart show the daily available quantity of the selected items in a given location for the past year.</p>
    <p>00:59: The bottom chart shows the daily issued out quantities (for inventory locations) or requested quantities (for par locations) for the past year.</p>
    <p>01:06: One can toggle the Weekly totals to see aggregated data on the bottom chart.</p>
    <p>01:11: When we pick the items from par locations, the daily available quantities chart will be empty, this is because the system does not track the daily balance on par locations.</p>
    <p>01:21: When we look at stage filter, we will notice only the items under tracking or pending clinical readiness are available, this is because we do not have the ability to report on items that are still pending their item number, and we do not necessarily care the status of deleted or completed conversions.</p>
    <p>01:37: As we set up different filtering criteria,</p>
    <p>01:40: The statistic card will automatically refresh to give us an ideas on the total active groups, item impacted and location impacted count.</p>
    <p>01:48: Click Reset to clear all applied filters and return to default view.</p>
    <p>01:53: Open the column selector to customize visible data, columns.</p>
    <p>01:57: We export the inventory locations or par locations table by clicking Export to Excel. It will open the window for us to further configurate on the rows and columns we would like to export out from the system.</p>
    <p>02:08: The export is default to currently visible items. Meaning, row-wise, it will only pick the filtered record, and column-wise, it will export all visible columns.</p>
    <p>02:18: If we want to run the report wide open and have a look on all items and item attributes that is available,</p>
    <p>02:25: We can just select all records and all columns.</p>
    <p>02:28: We also offer options for user to pick and choose the columns that they need. But please note your custom selections will only apply to this one single report, it is one time and the configurations will not saved.</p>
    <p>02:40: Click Download Excel and the system should make the report in Excel format. The download should be automatic, if your browser blocks the downloading, follow the browser's instruction to enable it.</p>
    <p>02:50: Click Toggle column presets to switch between different column configurations. Generally, when trying to set up items for inventory or par locations, we want the replacement item inherit the same bin locations, reorder policy, and transaction UOM; and we would like the replacement take the equivalent set up for its reorder points and max order quantity. The tracker will automatically resolve the appropriate set up when possible to facilitate the set up process.</p>
    <p>03:13: We may want to let our requisitioners know that we are having a conversion project going on and ask them to order the replacement item. The tracker reads past 365 days requisition history and finds out the requesters who have ordered the original items and pull their email addresses for you.</p>
    <p>03:28: If email communications on certain messages are desired, we can use this to easily find the requesters we want to communicate with and let them know we are converting item A to B.</p>
    <p>03:37: You have successfully navigated and utilized the dashboard to filter, analyze, and export inventory data. You also learned how to notify buyers about product conversions; for further assistance, explore related documentation or contact support.</p>
