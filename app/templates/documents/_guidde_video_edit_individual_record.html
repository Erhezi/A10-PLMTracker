    <p>00:00: This tutorial shows how to edit individual records, manage stage changes, and archive completed items.</p>
    <p>00:11: Each row includes an Edit button.</p>
    <p>00:13: Click Edit to begin modifying the record.</p>
    <p>00:17: Use the edit panel to change stage, add Wrike task IDs, or adjust the go-live date.</p>
    <p>00:25: The go-live date represents when the replacement item should be ready for use.</p>
    <p>00:32: That date usually follows completion of the related Wrike setup tasks.</p>
    <p>00:36: Stage transitions are restricted to valid pairs.</p>
    <p>00:41: Open the Stage dropdown to review the allowed options.</p>
    <p>00:46: Grayed-out stages cannot be selected to preserve lifecycle integrity.</p>
    <p>00:56: Pick the correct stage, enter the 10-digit Wrike ID, and set the go-live date.</p>
    <p>01:07: Save applies the changes.</p>
    <p>01:12: Rows marked Deleted remain editable while visible.</p>
    <p>01:20: Rows marked Tracking Completed are locked for reference only.</p>
    <p>01:29: Admins should periodically remove deleted or completed rows to keep the pipeline tidy.</p>
    <p>01:37: Contact an admin to revive completed tracking if needed.</p>
    <p>01:43: You have now edited a record, managed stages with guardrails, and archived finished work.</p>
