    <p>00:00: This tutorial shows how to manage supported item relations and resolve errors in the tracker.</p>
    <p>00:14: Example: item A and item B both convert to item X (many-to-one).</p>
    <p>00:23: Converting item A again to item Y introduces a many-to-many scenario.</p>
    <p>00:34: Clicking Create Links attempts to add the relation.</p>
    <p>00:40: The system skips creation and alerts you if the relation causes a conflict.</p>
    <p>00:47: Use the Conflict table to review failed attempts.</p>
    <p>00:53: Inspect the failed entries to understand why they were blocked.</p>
    <p>00:57: The tracker prevents chaining, reciprocal, self-directed, and many-to-many relations among active groups.</p>
    <p>01:07: After fixing the underlying issue, clear or purge the alert queue.</p>
    <p>01:14: You have managed item relations by adding valid links and resolving unsupported cases, keeping the tracker clean.</p>
