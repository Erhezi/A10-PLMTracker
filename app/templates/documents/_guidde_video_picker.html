    <p>00:00: This tutorial guides you through adding item relations using the item picker in the PLM tracker. You will learn how to link source and replacement items to establish conversion relationships efficiently.</p>
    <p>00:11: Now, let's look at how to establish item relations inside the PLM tracker using the collect table.</p>
    <p>00:17: When we try to establish the conversion relations between items, we offer two operation modes.</p>
    <p>00:23: Different operation modes include using the item pickers or using the batch upload functions.</p>
    <p>00:28: Please note, currently, under batch upload, we only support adding items if we know their six-digit Infor numbers for both items and replacement items.</p>
    <p>00:37: It is possible to establish the link between the conversions when item numbers are unknown.</p>
    <p>00:42: Under our replacement item picker, we have two search modes available.</p>
    <p>00:46: Instead of searching by the six-digit Infor item number, we can change the mode from item to contract.</p>
    <p>00:52: We searched the contract item by using the manufacturer part number as a key.</p>
    <p>00:57: Let's begin with the simplest case where we know the item numbers for both items and replacement items, a one-to-one relation.</p>
    <p>01:04: Click the search item field to look up the source item by its six-digit Infor item number.</p>
    <p>01:11: Enter your item number to locate the source item in the system.</p>
    <p>01:14: Select the appropriate source item from the search results.</p>
    <p>01:18: We first type in the item number on the left-hand side for the source item.</p>
    <p>01:23: On the left-hand side, enter the source item number to identify it.</p>
    <p>01:26: Click the search replacement field to find the replacement item by its six-digit Infor item number.</p>
    <p>01:33: Then type in the replacement item number to locate it.</p>
    <p>01:36: On the right-hand side, pick the replacement item and click the button to create links.</p>
    <p>01:41: You will see the items are now added to the tracker.</p>
    <p>01:45: The item group is assigned automatically by the system upon linking.</p>
    <p>01:48: Click the Groups tab to review item group assignments.</p>
    <p>01:53: To validate the successful addition, go to the Groups section.</p>
    <p>01:57: Take a look at the newly added item pairs to confirm the relations.</p>
    <p>02:02: You have successfully added item relations using the item picker by linking source and replacement items with known item numbers. The system automatically assigns item groups and you can verify the new relations in the Groups section.</p>
