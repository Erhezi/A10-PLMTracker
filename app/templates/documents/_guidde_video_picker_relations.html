    <p>00:00: This tutorial guides you through adding items using the picker covering various supported cases. You will learn how to establish different types of item relationships effectively.</p>
    <p>00:10: We previously showed how to add a simple one-to-one relationship.</p>
    <p>00:14: Through using the item picker.</p>
    <p>00:16: Now we are going to show some other supported cases.</p>
    <p>00:21: Click the search field labeled "Search item by six digit Infor item number" to begin locating an item.</p>
    <p>00:28: Enter the item number to identify the specific item you want to add.</p>
    <p>00:33: To mark the item as discontinued instead of substituting it, click <strong>Add NO REPLACEMENT</strong> under the right picker.</p>
    <p>00:40: Click the Create Links button to establish the item relationship.</p>
    <p>00:45: That creates an item relation tracked as discontinued.</p>
    <p>00:50: Sometimes the replacement item is not on the item master yet. You can still create the conversion, which will label the replacement as pending item number.</p>
    <p>01:03: Pick the source item as usual.</p>
    <p>01:07: On the replacement side, change the mode to contract.</p>
    <p>01:11: Use the "Search contract item (by Manufacturer Part Number)" field to find the replacement item.</p>
    <p>01:17: Search by manufacturer part number.</p>
    <p>01:21: Select the pending replacement item from the search results.</p>
    <p>01:28: The replacement displays with a pending prefix plus the manufacturer part number.</p>
    <p>01:37: When you create links, the tracker assigns the Pending Item Number stage.</p>
    <p>01:43: Open the Groups tab to view item groupings.</p>
    <p>01:47: Review the newly added pairs under Groups.</p>
    <p>01:51: Click Collect to manage item collections.</p>
    <p>01:55: The picker supports many-to-one and one-to-many conversions.</p>
    <p>02:03: Enter the first source item number to begin a many-to-one conversion.</p>
    <p>02:10: Add additional source items that will converge to one replacement.</p>
    <p>02:17: Select the target item to complete the many-to-one relationship.</p>
    <p>02:26: Create the links so the system assigns the shared item group.</p>
    <p>02:39: For one-to-many, select the source item that will split into multiple replacements.</p>
    <p>02:50: Enter and select each replacement item number.</p>
    <p>03:29: Create the links; the system handles the sanity checks.</p>
    <p>03:42: Back on the Groups tab you can confirm the new relationships.</p>
    <p>03:48: You have successfully added items using the picker across one-to-one, discontinued, pending, many-to-one, and one-to-many cases. The system validates and tracks these item groups for efficient management.</p>
