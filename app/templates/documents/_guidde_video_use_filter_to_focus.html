    <p>00:00: This tutorial guides you through managing item groups on the main page and using filters to focus on specific items. You will learn how to navigate the interface and apply different filter options to streamline your workflow.</p>
    <p>00:12: One click on the Groups tab lands you on the main tracker page.</p>
    <p>00:17: Review the full list of items whose conversion progress you want to monitor.</p>
    <p>00:22: Source items sit on the left side; replacement items sit on the right.</p>
    <p>00:29: The example shows over 100 item groups currently in scope.</p>
    <p>00:34: Apply filters to focus on only the items you care about right now.</p>
    <p>00:39: The quick filter matches text across item description, manufacturer, manufacturer number, and item number.</p>
    <p>00:48: Use the dropdown next to the free-text input to switch filter modes.</p>
    <p>00:54: The default mode is Contains.</p>
    <p>00:58: Typing glove filters every row that includes glove in the supported fields.</p>
    <p>01:08: Only rows with glove in the description remain visible.</p>
    <p>01:11: Use semicolons to search for multiple values at once.</p>
    <p>01:16: Enter tube;glove to display both tubes and gloves.</p>
    <p>01:21: Clear All resets the filters.</p>
    <p>01:26: Not Contains excludes the entered text from the results.</p>
    <p>01:33: Filter by Item Group to isolate numeric group IDs when resolving conflicts; semicolons support multiple groups.</p>
    <p>01:49: The Stage filter highlights lifecycle buckets and keeps Wrike tasks organized.</p>
    <p>02:00: Stage totals appear at the bottom of the page.</p>
    <p>02:08: Click the info icon to jump to the documentation pages.</p>
    <p>02:14: Use the Stage Transition Guide tab for a refresher on stage logic.</p>
    <p>02:23: Click Groups to return to the item group page.</p>
    <p>02:26: Item and Replace Item filters accept up to 100 numbers at once.</p>
    <p>02:35: Clear All removes every active filter and resets the view.</p>
    <p>02:41: You have successfully applied multiple filters to manage item groups efficiently.</p>
